                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                                BitMagic Library v.5.0.0 implemented new type of compressed serialization.
                                The change is to add Binary Interpolated coding scheme. This application notes documents
                                collected benchmarking statistics, thoughts and observations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Sorted lists are commonly used in information retrieval and databases or as part of a upper
                                level application compression scheme. Bit-vectors are often used as a representation of
                                sorted lists and implement highly efficient set-theoretical operations such as
                                set union (OR), set intersect (AND), etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another interesting application is bit-transposed succinct vectors, where each bit-plain
                                is a separately encoded bit-vector. All such containers are to be serialized and saved at
                                some point, which is where better compression plays an important role in optimizing
                                storage costs operation latency and performance per watt efficiency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Better compression pays off, because disk is the new tape!
                            </p>

                            <h2>Serialization-compression notes</h2>

                            <p>
                                BitMagic uses partitioned scheme, splitting the source bit-vector into smaller
                                blocks of 64K bits each. Compression scheme follows this pattern adaptively picking
                                the best representation for each block. This scheme was proposed by Culpepper and Moffat
                                as HYB+M2 and this idea was implemented in BitMagic library as an adaptive scheme
                                which keeps some bit-blocks as bit-blocks maybe with minimal compression
                                but tries to compress sparse blocks using delta differential coding with Elias Gamma step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BitMagic v5.0.0, tries an alternative second stage, it uses Interpolative Coding
                                (with Centered Minimal code assignment) for blocks which were selected as compression targets.
                                The overall scheme remain hybrid with a number of heuristics, for example it detects very dense blocks and
                                is capable to encode complementary positions of ‘0’, instead of ‘1’s. Optimizations like these are important
                                for compression of dense bit-sets which are often formed in applications other than text retrieval.
                            </p>

                                        Compression scenario. Loads data from little endian size prefixed raw dump,
                                        makes minimal verification of data integrity, imports data into <code>bm::bvector&lt;&gt;</code>, serializes it to disk.

                                    <li>
                                        Verification - retrieval scenario. Loads data from initial dump and
                                        from compressed collection, performs a deserialization and decode pass on
                                        bm::bvector&lt;&gt; to make sure it matches the original.

                                As you can see, the measurements include various I/O factors and elements of application
                                logic (verification), which makes it more difficult to compare.
                                We see this experiment as more holistic way to study the compression code as a part of a
                                bigger application ecosystem. This is important for practical engineering.
                            </p>

                            <p>We can tweak the test set later to measure compression-decompression isolate from QC factors.</p>

                                Benchmark data are derived from Gov2 data set. Experiment touches two different datasets of
                                inverted lists: Gov2 Sorted and Gov2 Unsorted. Sorted dataset preprocessed the input pages so data
                                from one site comes more together, forming better runs in the inverted lists.
                            </p>

                            <p>Both Elias Gamma and Interpolated Coding algorithms at this moment do not include 
                            any SIMD optimizations. The differences in performance comes from block to int conversion 
                            algorithms and compression assessment, which are benefit from use of SSE4.2 with POPCNT 
                            and AVX2.
                            </p>

                            

                            <p>
                                Interpolative compression offers benefits in storage volume, compression algorithm 
                                is CPU intensive, and not memory intensive, which is good - it means it should be 
                                possible to significantly improve performance with SSE4.2 and AVX2 vectorization.
                            </p>
