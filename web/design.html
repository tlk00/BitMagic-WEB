                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>
                        BitMagic library implements a pipeline of compression algorithms
                        for succinct vectors (dense or sparse). In its core it is based on
                        bit-vectors and logical operations and similarity measures.
                        In this topic we discuss an overview of algorithms and relationships
                        between succinct and compressive methods in the compression pipeline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bit-vectors are widely used is scientific computing and artificial intelligence.
                        Binary fingerprints, clustering, classification based systems need
                        efficient, parallel set operations.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Big Picture</h2>

                    <p>
                        The backbone of BitMagic library is its implementation of bit-vector
                        (<code>bm::bvector&lt;&gt;</code>). The implementation is a Swiss knife
                        API which provides variety of functions to set and retrieve bits as
                        inverted integer lists, run <a href="set-algebra.html">Algebra of Sets operations</a>,
                        high-performance Rank-Select
                        (accelerated Rank-Select index), bit shifts, fast logical scans, similarity measures and distances.
                        All this functionalities define building blocks for data science and
                        applied for compression or containers
                        (BitMagic implements STL-like container classes)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>bm::bvector&lt;&gt;</code> and all other containers use a
                        concept of two stage operation:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Succinct in memory. Succinct is NOT a compression. Succinct data structures use                                         compressive techniques, to minimize memory footprint but
                                provide easy access to reading, modifications (some limitations here) and search
                                functions.The trade-off here leans towards operations
                                (like search) rather than compression, but operations are
                                performed in succinct form, which saves both memory and
                                RAM-CPU bandwidth at the expense of some CPU (ALU) utilization,
                                which is usually a good trade-off.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Compressed - serialized BLOB. When saved to disk succinct data structures use deep
                                compression algorithms. The focus here is not fast operation necessarily but fast
                                decompression (this is typical for analytics and IR workloads).
                                One of the design principles here is provide APIs to easily
                                extract portions (ranges) of data vectors from the serialized                                     BLOBs keeping technical details of windows of compression,
                                transformations kept under the hood.
                                <br />
                                The use case example: have big data frame, it does not fit in
                                memory, your design choice is naturally to use database system
                                (SQL or non-SQL).
                                <br />
                                Use of a database will solve the problem, but there is an alternative you
                                can have data model in memory in compressed form, and decode
                                parts of it to the stage 1 (succinct) and compute faster than
                                if it is a database. We are extending the amount of operational RAM
                                by using compression techniques right in our application at the level
                                of data structures.
                                Staying in-memory is important for
                                variety of analytical workloads, visualization and latency sensitive
                                services.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        Take home: BitMagic does not use full decompression, it decodes data to succinct form.
                        Partial decompression is both faster and saves memory.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Compressive techniques for bm::bvector&lt;&gt;</h2>

                    <p>
                        <span class="image left"><img src="images/BM-design1.png" width="1024" alt="bm::bvector<> compression" /></span>
                        <h3>Stage 1</h3>
                        <h3>H-compression</h3>
                    <p>
                        bm::bvector&lt;&gt; organizes data in a fixed depth tree of blocks.
                        Blocks are fixed size of 64Kilo-bits (16-bit address internal space).
                        At first data blocks are true bit-blocks. This is a basically hierarchical
                        compression techniques used in many sparse structures, hash maps, etc.
                        The goal here is allow sparse cases when data is filled in the upper spectrum of
                        addresses or forms significant (more than 64K gaps of 0s or 1s). BitMagic handles
                        both sparse (lots of 0s) and dense (lots of 1s cases).
                        In many IR schemes dense cases are simply ignored as noise (stop lists)
                        but this limits applicability for compression of scientific data models
                        where dense is meaningful and must be preserved.
                    </p>
                    <h3>D-GAP (delta-gap) compression</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our next step (succinct) is to analyze bit-blocks and make
                        decision on which blocks exhibit clear patterns of 0000s and 1s and
                        should be compressed as a list of integers, which is a form or RLE
                        (run-length encoding). D-GAP variant of RLE keeps data as a list of
                        monotonically growing integers from 0 to 65535 (16-bit unsigned int)
                        describing every position in bit block where run pattern changes
                        (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). Think of it as a binary signal,
                        impulse code modulation or the like.
                        <br />
                        Properties of D-GAP:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Pseudo-random access. The value of any bit can be found using O(logN) binary search.
                                BitMagic often uses vectorized hybrid search which is formally still logarithmic,
                                but faster (wonders of computer science vs practical engineering).
                                Since N is capped by the maximum of (65535) we call is "pseudo random access".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All logical (set theoretical operations) are possible and implemented
                                (OR, AND, XOR, NOT, AND-NOT, etc). DGAP can be even faster than on bit-blocks,
                                it depends on particular distributions of bits.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allows modifications via insertion sort O(N^2) worst case.
                                In practice inserytion happens within the boundaries of L1 CPU cache and are fast.
                                Something worth mentioning here is that BitMagic uses memory reservations to
                                let insertion sort do its job without frequent re-allocations (heap access kills performance).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 2</h3>

                    <span class="image left"><img src="images/BM-design2.png" width="1024" alt="bm::bvector<> compression" /></span>

                    <p>
                        Stage 2 is serialization with compression performed by <code>bm::serializer&lt;&gt;</code> class.

                        <br />

                        <h3>S2.1 Heuristics</h3>
                        The goal for the heuristics is to balance desired compression level and find possible best representations. It works on the per-block level, sometimes escalates to super-blocks.
                        Representations to name a few: lists of integers representing 1s, list of GAPs, h-compressed blocks, list of integers representing 0s or uncompressed bit-blocks.

                        <br />

                        <h3>S2.2 Encoder</h3>

                        Encoder uses either Elias-Gamma codes or Binary Interpolative Coding Centered Minimal (BIC-CM)
                        to compress. BIC-CM is better by a large margin, Elias-Gamma is still useful for
                        encoding lists of unordered small integers or for cases when we need faster serialization.

                        <h3>S2.3 Bookmarking</h3>

                        BitMagic allows fast decompression of ranges and gather decompression.
                        If the use case needs this functionality you can instruct serializer to add bookmarks
                        to facilitate fast range decode. Bookmarks obviously add a bit of overhead,
                        but also make range decode significantly faster. Bookmarking is enabled with set_bookmarks()
                        function, where you define how often to add bookmarks (in number of blocks).
                        Lower the number more precise and faster the decode would be (somewhat inflating the BLOB size).
                        You have to experiment to find the desired bookmark setting, usually it is between
                        16 and 256. Bookmarks are NOT turned ON by default but you still can still use range
                        gather deserialization - it will work with a penalty of doing some extra decompressions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bit-plane transposed vectors</h2>

                    <span class="image left"><img src="images/BM-design3.png" width="1024" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>
                        BitMagic implements succinct vectors for integers and strings based on bitwise transposition,
                        also known as bit-plane compression (BPC) or bit-slicing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bit-plane transformation is an equivalent data representation where each bit-wise position
                        (bit 0, 1, 2, 3 …) are extricated (sliced) and kept as independent bit-vectors.
                        This transformation is lossless and reversible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Integer and string succinct vectors have great utility in data
                        science models in the next areas:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IR</li>
                            <li>signal / graph / time series compression</li>
                            <li>bio-informatics (alignments, k-mers, DNA/protein sequences, reads)</li>
                            <li>knowledge graphs and NLP models</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        BitMagic is a bit-vector library in its core, bit-plane compression is a natural fit here.
                        Unlike some other compression systems BitMagic takes bit-transposition transform
                        as succinct method, not as a pure compression.
                        All containers in BitMagic remain in bit-transposed form
                        (as a row-major bit-matrix or collection of bit-vectors)
                        and provide R/W access to elements restoring it on the fly.
                        The reason for that is not just saved memory but also ability to do fast search in
                        sorted and unsorted arrays in memory compact, bit-transposed from (without reverse transformation)
                        using vectorized set theoretical operations.

                    <p>
                        In many cases bit-transposed vectors are both memory compact and fast to search.
                        Search is important for BitMagic as an IR library.

                        BitMagic supports 3 basic types of bit-transposed vectors:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <code>bm::sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code>  - bit-transposed succinct container
                                for scalar integer arrays
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>bm::rsc_sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code> - bit-transposed succinct
                                container for scalar integer arrays compressing with Rank-Select operation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>bm::str_sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code> - bit-transposed succinct container for
                                strings (fixed max size), used for scientific and NLP dictionaries, dictionary compression,
                                bio-informatics data models (such as k-mers, sequence reads, genome variation data, etc).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        All vectors are somewhat misleadingly called “sparse” because
                        the all are based on “sparse” bm::bvector&lt;&gt; but in fact
                        this containers work perfectly with the dense arrays.
                        <br />
                        All vectors support a notion of NULL value (unassigned vector element)
                        coming from the RDBMS world. It is implemented as an additional
                        NULL plane (presence-absence bit-vector). BitMagic can be used for in-memory
                        columnar databases.

                    <p>RSC vector uses additional Rank-Select compression on top of bit-planes. Fig 4.</p>

                    <p>
                        Rank-Select compression uses the idea of systematically dropping the
                        unassigned NULL columns of the transposed matrix. This transform uses NULL vector and an
                        additional Rank-Select index to recalculate logical (external) indexes into internal
                        (succinct matrix column numbers).
                        RSC vector is naturally slower than <code>bm::sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code> for
                        random element access, but more compact.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        RSC vector can be modified later, adding elements is relatively fast, but setting
                        new values in the middle require bit-shifts in all active bit-planes which can be
                        computationally hard problem. BitMagic uses SIMD to accelerate this, but it is
                        still a computationally hard problem magic can't solve that.

                        Bit-transposed vector for strings. To better understand this compression scheme
                        first transpose strings into a text matrix (getting a matrix to string position, than apply
                        bit-transposition to every character vector (similar to how <code>bm::sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code>
                        does it for integers).

                    <p>
                        This vector works well for the next major cases:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                All strings in the vector have positional locality like
                                technical or scientific identifiers. Being designed to have meaningful system of prefixes,
                                suffices, etc. Examples: dictionary of stars and galaxies,
                                list of known mutations or structural variations,
                                nomenclature of chemical compounds, etc
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Strings does not have positional locality, but use limited alphabet
                                (compared to full 256 ASCII list). Example: DNA (or protein) sequence k-mers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sorted dictionaries. Sorting enforces order and positional
                                locality, so lower parts of strings may become subject of
                                RLE compression (on the bit-level).
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        <code>bm::str_sparse_vector&lt;&gt;</code> implements an additional transform:
                        character remapping. Character codes in all planes are analyzed for occurrence
                        frequencies per plane to assign lowest codeword to most frequent characters.
                        Similar codeword assignment is used in Huffman coding.
                        BitMagic applies as a succinct approach together with bit-transposed planes.
                        <br />
                        Remapping is an optional step, it limits the ability to modify the vector.
                        <br />
                        Remapping usually improves the internal structure of bit-vectors (for faster search),
                        reducing number of active bit-planes (internal enthropy),
                        but it may not have a necessarily positive effect on Stage 2 compression,
                        because of the overhead to store the remap matrix. It is advised to experiment with
                        the dataset to determine if remap step is necessary.

                        BitMagic implements a <a href="bm-xor.html">XOR filter</a>, an optional compressive
                        transform based on Hamming distance. XOR filter can be applied for an individual

                        XOR filer uses properties of XOR codes and similarity-dissimilarity metrics

                        block and reduce entropy. XOR compression is a natural fit for bit-plane transform,
                        because it exposes internal correlations in the data vectors, specific to some scientific data sets
